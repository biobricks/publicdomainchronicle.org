      <h2>A Network</h2>

      <p>Anyone can run a Public Domain Chronicle server that accepts new submissions and can republishes submissions from other servers automatically.</p>

      <p>Many PDC servers are better than one:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Servers that republish each other&rsquo;s submissions corroborate each other&rsquo;s timestamps, creating even stronger evidence that a finding was published as prior art by a particular time.</li>

        <li>Servers that republish each other&rsquo;s submissions back up each other&rsquo;s data.</li>

        <li>Severs can customize the submission form to make it easier for particular kinds of contributors. For example, the BioBricks Foundation hosts <a href=https://pdc.biobricks.org>a PDC server for synthetic biologists</a>.</li>

        <li>Servers can provide their own search and indexing interfaces for particular kinds of research and reference.</li>
      </ul>
