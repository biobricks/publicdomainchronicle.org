      <h1>Host a Server</h1>

      <p>Anyone can run a DBOS server to accept new submissions and republish submissions from other DBOS servers.  Many DBOS servers are better than one:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Servers that republish each other&rsquo;s submissions corroborate each other&rsquo;s timestamps, creating even stronger evidence that a finding was published by a particular time as prior art.</li>

        <li>Servers that republish each other&rsquo;s submissions back up each other&rsquo;s data.</li>

        <li>Severs can adapt the submission form to make it easier for particular kinds of contributors to describe their findings.</li>
      </ul>
